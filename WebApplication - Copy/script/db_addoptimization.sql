These robots will be able to perform a variety of functions that will make life easier, safer and economical. The Milagrow Redhawk Vacuum Cleaner is one such robot thatperforms multiple tasks to ensure your home is clean by the time you get back from work.\r\nThe Milagrow Redhawk Vacuum Cleaner is classified as a robotic vacuum cleaner that can deal with both dry and wet surfaces. The Redhawk is a bag-less model that has a 1 litre dust bin to store the dirt it collects. The average power consumption for this robot is about 45 to 60 W. The suction power ranges from 10 to 15 W depending on the intensity of cleaning required. This battery operated Redhawk uses 6 different modes to clean effectively with minimal noise.\r\nBody\r\nThe Milagrow Redhawk Vacuum Cleaner has a circular shape with flat ends on both the top and bottom. There are four operational buttons located around the digital screen that shows the current settings on which the Redhawk is performing. The dust bin, which collects the dirt, is located at the back just above the exhaust vent.\r\nThe Redhawk has a base clearance of 2.3 cm which allows it to travel across a range of surfaces and clean without stalling. This Power Vac has a 14.4 V Li rechargeable battery with a storage capacity of 2000 mAh. The Infrared sensor is positioned at the front just above the digital screen.\r\nPerformance Features\r\nThe Milagrow Redhawk Vacuum Cleaner takes about 3 to 4 hours to fully charge its batteries before it goes about cleaning the house. This Power Vac can perform an hour of non-stop cleaning on a full charge. The maximum airflow is 100 dm3 per minute which can remove tough dirt and dust easily.\r\nThe Milagrow Redhawk Vacuum Cleaners settings can be programed with the infrared remote control. The remote control has a range of 7 m which allows you to feed instructions to the Redhawk Vacuum Cleaner. The wheels of this Power Vac have a suspension system that allows the Redhawk to easily move from the ground to a carpet or rug. The suspension system also makes sure that the suction head is at the right height for optimal use.\r\nConvenience Features\r\nThe Milagrow RedHawk Robotic Vacuum Cleaner comes with a variety of features that make your home safe and clean. The RedHawk will start cleaning the house at the pre-scheduled time, once its done cleaning or is low (less than 15%) on battery power, it will return by itself to the docking station to recharge. The Redhawk follows the infrared signal emitted by the docking station and docks itself to the charger.\r\nThis robot automatically detects obstacles. When RedHawk knocks into something, its bumper retracts, activatingmechanical object sensors that realize it has encountered an obstacle, it then performs the sequential actions of backing up, rotating and moving forward until it finds a clear path.\r\nThis Power Vac can also detect the edges of stairs and beds to avoid falling off. It uses a cliff sensor which constantly sends out infrared signals, if these infrared signals do not bounce back to the Power Vac, it instantly stops and chooses a different cleaning path.\r\nThis Robotic Vacuum Cleaner can also kill germs, viruses and bacteria using its unique UV bulb. The UV bulb that is found underneath the RedHawk kills the micro-organisms by penetrating them and disrupting their genetic material. The Robotic 3 Way Cleaning process also ensures that pet hair & skin flakes are picked up, thereby making the ground safe for toddlers and children.\r\nThe Milagrow RedHawk has the ability to vary its cleaning intensity based on the amount of dirt, the Automatic Dirt Detection software lets the Power Vac know that it has to increase its suction power when it identifies high dirt areas. This detection ability follows the same mining-detection algorithms as used by many militaries worldwide.\r\nThe RedHawk employs 3 main spot cleaning modes to ensure exhaustive cleaning. The spot wall-to-wall cleaningthat is suitable for hard dirt, makes sure that the entire room is cleaned in a methodical manner along the walls. In thespot spiral mode, the Power Vac cleans in concentric circles which is extremely suitable for cleaning tough spots thoroughly. In the Zig Zag mode, the robot cleans dirty spots with Auto Intelligent Optimal cleaning.\r\nAnother interesting functionality of this product is the Infrared Space Isolation. Invisible barriers can be set up using the virtual walls available with the Power Vac to mark off areas. The Virtual Wall sends out infrared signals that the robot picks up with the receiver on its bumper, it then turns around and heads the other way.\r\n', 'Floor cleaner', 'Cleaner,Floor cleaner', NULL, '0', 'Y'),

The coffee maker features a clean and simple interface and makes for an ideal appliance for those on the lookout for an uncomplicated coffee maker. The 0.6 liter water tank capacity of the Philips HD7450 translates to 6 cups of coffee.\r\nThe Philips HD7450 features a high funnel type filter that allows for even distribution of the coffee powder. This ensures optimal contact between the powder and water, thereby lending a full-bodied flavor and aroma to your coffee. The thermostat controlled hotplate in the Philips coffee machine can keep the decoction warm for extended periods. This is a useful feature for late afternoon lethargy where you desperately crave for a coffee, but too lazy to actually go brew a fresh cup.\r\nThe Drip stop feature in the Philips coffee maker is a useful inclusion; this allows you to interrupt the brewing process any time you like. Just pull out the Glass carafe and the machine will pause the brewing till you replace it in the initial position. It is however recommended that you do not interrupt the process midway as the coffee acquires full flavor only at the end of the brewing cycle.\r\nThe Philips 7450 comes with several useful features that add to your convenience. All detachable parts of the Philips HD7450 Coffee Maker are dishwasher-safe. The Cord Control inclusion saves you from the hassle of dealing with tangled up wires. The coffee machine comes with a translucent water tank which allows you to keep a constant check on the water level.\r\nAnother highlight of the Philips HD7450 is the relatively short brew time of 8 minutes. It is a highly desired feature in a coffee maker as longer brew time tends to add a slight bitterness to your coffee. Filter-fine ground coffee powder works best with this Philips coffee machine as it allows the water to evenly coat the granules. Consistency is another huge deal-clincher for coffee makers, and this is where the Philips HD7450 truly excels.

The one small village of indomitable Gauls still holding out against the invaders is slowly zoomed into. In this first ever adventure, the Romans, led by Centurion Crismus Bonus attempt to figure out what gave the Gauls their superhuman strength. They find that the secret lies in a potion brewed by their fearsome (yet rather fatherly) druid, Getafix. This leads them to their first ever attempt to capture the venerable druid, which they manage to do without a snag, at least initially.\r\nThe druid is captured and tortured until the torturer is utterly exhausted and stunned by the resistance of Getafix to his methods. Instead, they capture Asterix, who had caught wind of the Romans? scheme and snuck into their camp, and try to torture him instead, which works brilliantly ? so brilliantly that the torturer hardly had to tie him down before the Gaulish warrior began to beg for mercy. This forces Getafix to comply with the Romans? demand to brew his secret potion for them and goes on to give them an elaborate list of ingredients. But what exactly will the druid concoct? Will it be his famous magic potion or do Asterix and Getafix have other tricks up their sleeves?\r\nAsterix The Gaul was named the twenty third most influential book of the twentieth century by the magazine Le Monde. It was first serialized in the French comic magazine Pilote before it was compiled into the well known first volume.
